<div>
  <p>Requests the Release Number for the selected BuildMaster application from BuildMaster and injects these environment 
  variables into the build job:
	<ul>
	  <li>BUILDMASTER_APPLICATION_ID</li>
	  <li>BUILDMASTER_RELEASE_NUMBER</li>
	  <li>BUILDMASTER_BUILD_NUMBER</li>
	  <li>BUILDMASTER_DEPLOYABLE_ID</li>
  	</ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>Because the Release Number and build numbers could be required by several build and post-build actions selecting the application and setting up 
  the environment variable has been separated from the trigger build action.</p>
</div>
